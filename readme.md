# Online Job Portal
For my BCA 6th-semester project, I developed an advanced "Online Job Portal" using Django. This platform facilitates job searches, allowing employers to post listings, questions for assessment, and shortlist candidates through the platform directly. And candidates can apply, give assessment, upload resume and track the status of job. It incorporates user-friendly interfaces, resume uploading, and search capabilities, contributing to a streamlined and efficient recruitment process.
